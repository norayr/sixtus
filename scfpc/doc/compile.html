<h1>Seksi Commander - How compile Seksi Commander</h1>
<h2>What you need?</h2>
<p>At first must download <a href="http://www.freepascal.org/">FreePascal</a>.
I use FPC 1.9.3 (2.0 beta3). In some distribution is FreePascal included (for
example in MDK in <strong>fpc</strong> package), but this is stable version.</p>
<p>After this download <a href="http://lazarus.freepascal.org/">Lazarus</a>.
Seksi Commander use Lazarus from CVS.</p>
<p>Now this <a href="download.html">download Seksi Commander source code</a>. In downloaded
file is included also <strong>viewercontrol</strong>, so install it to the Lazarus. Now open
file <strong>sc.lpi</strong> or <strong>scgtk2.lpi</strong>. In second case you must
also download gtk2forpascal from source forge. Warning: gtk2 version of seksi commander
not work properly (editor crash and movement in panels is slow).</p>
<h2>Running Seksi Commander</h2>
<p>Simple go to directory with Seksi Commander and <strong>./sc</strong>. All files are
stored in this directory. In final version will be in home directory.</p>
<h2>Some hints</h2>
<p>If you uses Lazarus with <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">XFce</a> disable CTRL+SHIFT UP, DOWN (move between
declaration and implementation) in configuration of windows manager.</p>
