<h1>Seksi Commander dokumentace</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Seksi Commander is a filemanager for X11 and Linux. In this moment is
only x86 version available. Seksi commander is inspired by mix of Total
Commander, Midnight Commander and my imagine.
<h2>Development info</h2>
<p>Seksi Commander is written in Object Pascal (Kylix and now in FPC+Lazarus).</p>
<h2>License</h2>
<p>Program Seksi Commander is released under terms of GNU GPL v 2.</p>
<p>For internal editor Seksi Commander use SynEdit components,
which is released under Mozilla Public License or/and GNU GPL 2 (included in Lazarus).</p>
<p>For integrated viewer I wrote whole new component ViewerControl (mmaped bin, hex, text mode) and
released under same licence as Seksi Commander (GNU GPL 2).</p>

  <li>file operation with threads (and in near future at background) -
file copy, file move, delete</li>

copying, moving and deleting I planed about 5.7.2003)</li>
  <li>lynx like directory movement</li>
  <li>integrated editor with syntax hightlighting</li>
  <li>integrated file viewer (text, hex, bin, graphics)</li>

  <li>selecting files by INS</li>
  <li>HotDir</li>
  <li>* FTP</li>

  <li>Directory history (last 50)</li>
  <li>Shift+F6 like Total Commander</li>
  <li>configure operation on file (by definition in sc.ext)</li>
  <li>colorize items in panels by file ext</li>
  <li>multi language support (in this moment:)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>English</li>
    <li>Czech</li>

  </ul>
  <li>and many other </li>
</ul>
<p>If you need anything else, try to write or write wish to mailing list
:-).</p>
<h2>Viewer</h2>
<p>Integrated File Viewer have this modes: (text, bin, hex, wrapped text,
processing file).</p>
<p>Also can directly show this images :JPG, PNG, BMP, ICO, XPM, TGA, VMF.</p>
<p>If you select more than one file, can browse selected files with keys
N(ext), P(rior) (like Lister in Total Commander). Switch file showing
mode with menu or keys 1, 2, 3, 4, (5 is currently disabled).</p>
<p>Program access files throught mmap (text modes) or for graphics load
file to memory.</p>
<h3>Text mode</h3>
<p>In this mode viewer show file as text. ASCII codes &lt;32 are showed as
spaces, only ASCII code 9 is replaced by some spaces (by current cursor
position). Code 10 and code 13 is interpreted as new line. If line is
too long, program wrap text and continued on next line.</p>
<h3>Text wrapped text</h3>
<p>Like text mode, but with wrapping on 80 chars.</p>
<h3>Mode bin</h3>
<p>In this mode all codes &lt;32 are replaced with space and wrap text at
80 chars.</p>
<h3>Mode hex</h3>
<p>Show file in hex. Also show ASCII codes in right column.</p>
<h3>Mode process </h3>
<p><em>(currenly disabled) Program search in file <strong>sc.ext</strong>
for View command and display result (result is readed from stdout of
this command). If View command not found, mode is not changed.</em></p>
<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>Integrated editor have keyboard mapping aka Borlands IDE. I use <strong>SynEdit</strong>
components. This component package is written for Delphi and Kylxi port
is only few months old. In windows with this components are writen many
programs (like PSPad, HydraPHP ...).</p>
<p>If you can other syntax highlighting that includes in editor, must use
synedit generator (part of synedit package). Generator is based on lex.</p>
<p>In new version is implemented search and replace (from synedit demos).</p>
<h2>Multi rename tool</h2>
<p>This dialog is inspired (but written from scratch) by Total Commander
and <strong>total</strong> redesigned.</p>
<h2>Compare files dialog</h2>
<p>Work in two modes: bin, text. Written in scratch.</p>
<h2>How can I send bugreport</h2>
<p>At first moment see <a href="status.html">status</a> if your bug is
known. For some of bugs (most not my) I implement temporally workaround
what may not worked at every system (see dead key problem with synedit).</p><p>
In release version is a bug too if no shortcut (on button, menu ...) or
any feature is not available without mouse. Program must be controled
without mouse!</p>
<p>In development version send only critical error (crash, error messages,
hang up, strange message and so).</p>
<p>Send bugs (and wish) to mailing list (in english or in czech) see <a
 href="authors.html">authors and contacts</a>.</p>
<h2>How can install Seksi Commander?</h2>
<p>Exists two ways: compile source or install binary.</p> 
<p>For binary instalation download file <b>develxxxxx</b>.tgz.
Where xxxxx is something other than xxxxx :-). develxxxx is development
package and at this moment not exists any release package.</p><p>Simple unpack
files from archive where you want and execute <strong>sc</strong>.
In this development version package is only unpacked to any directory.
At release version will be changed.</p>
<h2>Files of Seksi Commander</h2>
<p>Main program is <b>sc</b>. There is no starting script(!). 
<p>In <b>lng</b> subdirectory are language files. Seksi commander can use
any file with lng extension (no other registration is needed).</p>
<p>In main directory (from version 0.4) exists file <strong>sc.ext</strong> 
(based on mc.ext). In this file are descripted actions for any extension 
(for popup menu, execute or viewing ...)</p><p>Definitions of file colors in panel are in 
<strong>color.ext</strong>, format of file is descripted at begin (very simple).</p>
<p>In file <strong>pixmaps.txt</strong> are defined pixmaps for files.</p>
